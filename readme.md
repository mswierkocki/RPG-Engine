# RPG Engine
> Summertime team C++ project. Developed during summer 2012. 

 When summer has begun, me and two other friends thought. It would be nice to create game on our own. So we began to write concepts and ideas. During first implementation of the game we realized that we need somehow to edit our game contents. After while we spend over 3 months developing our Game editor and summer was over such as this project.

Editor capatibilities:
- Loading/saving Maps
- Terrain tool
- Object Manager
- Object Browser
- Scenes Manager
- Textures and Animations Manager
- Build paths
- Map properties
- Unfinished Script manager
